## Description

> Mastodon is the largest decentralized social network on the internet. Instead of a single website, it’s a network of millions of users in independent communities that can all interact with one another, seamlessly. No matter what you’re into, you can meet passionate people posting about it on Mastodon!
> Join a community and create your profile. Find and and follow fascinating folks and read their posts in an ad-free, chronological timeline. Express yourself with custom emoji, images, GIFs, videos, and audio in 500-character posts. Reply to threads and reblog posts from anyone to share great stuff. Find new accounts to follow and trending hashtags to expand your network.
> Mastodon is built with a focus on privacy and safety. Decide whether your posts are shared with your followers, just the people you mention, or the whole world. Content warnings let you hide posts containing sensitive or triggering material until you're ready to engage with them. Each community has its own guidelines and moderators to keep its members safe, and robust blocking and reporting tools help prevent abuse.
> More features:
> - Dark Mode: Read posts in light, dark, or true black mode
> - Polls: Ask followers for their opinion and tally the votes
> - Explore: Trending hashtags and accounts are a tap away
> - Notifications: Get notified about new follows, replies, and reblogs
> - Sharing: Post directly to Mastodon from any share sheet in any app
> -Cuteness: Our mascot is an adorable elephant, and you'll see them pop up from time to time
> Mastodon is a registered nonprofit and development is supported directly by your donations. There’s no advertising, no monetization, and no venture capital, and we plan to keep it that way.
