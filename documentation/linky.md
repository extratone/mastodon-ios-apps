## Description

Linky lets you easily share webpage links, images and text extracts to Twitter and Mastodon from your iPhone and iPad.

Write your post, choose which preferred social networks and Linky will do the rest! You can connect Linky to Twitter and Mastodon.

Linky's very own iOS Share Extension allows you to post messages without ever leaving third-party applications.

Want to share a webpage Link? Linky can insert both the url and the title of the webpage as required. Linky will suggest images related to shared links and can attach them to your messages. It can also shorten links, giving you access to further link analytics.

How about selected text in Safari? Linky's Web Clipper extracts selected text and carries it over to the composer sheet, ready for you to edit. You can also make a text shot from the text selection for sharing as a beautiful image.

What about a great photo? Share images easily from Photos app and third-party applications. You can also preview the shared image in fullscreen before sending it.

Share any text too! Bring up the extension, the text is copied in the message, edit if required and share. It's that simple.

Use Markup to annotate, crop and edit images inline. Write or draw on the attachment, or add arrows and lenses, or obscure sensitive information.

"Linky 5.0 removes friction from sharing links, quotes, and images. I appreciate the intelligent use of Open Graph and Twitter Cards to save even more time, and I'm a fan of the deeper controls Linky brings when compared to the default share sheet of Twitter. I can't recommend Linky enough." - MacStories

"Linky turbocharges sharing links and images to Twitter from Safari or other apps supporting iOS extensions." 4/5 - Macworld

@benoitsan hi Benoit! I've been working on adding Linky to my repository collecting iOS apps for Mastodon and noticed that the Dropbox link to the press kit appears to be broken. is there any way I could grab that from you?

releaseNotes=- Added support for new iPhone (late 2020) screen sizes.

- Added support for extracting the text, links and pictures from Twitter tweet URLs.
